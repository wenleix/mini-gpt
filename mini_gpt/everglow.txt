Saying goodbye to the sunset
Your sad melody echoes through the darkest sky
Long, long ago, here now, and gone
People have lived, prayed, and sang a song
With their fragile memories

The rain won't stop falling
Drizzling, blurred streets
My heart is soaking too
Can't tell how much I wish you were here
Wanna laugh with you right now

Waiting for sunrise
All day, you're on my mind
I don't know what to do
Tomorrow I won't be crying
I'm talking to myself again and again
If I'm free, will I be saved?

Now is the time to say goodbye
I must move forward
Knowing that I'm not ready for it
Let me believe that you'll be there
Let's go out to see the moonlight with me

Every time I blink, I see a new sight
It makes me feel dizzy
We will all disappear someday
Like the bubble blown away

Through the clouds, I see the sky
It's so blue, I felt a beauty
Sunlight shines into the room
I'm sure I've seen this view before

Waiting for sunrise
My fear never goes away
And still overflows
That's why I hid in the night
The moments of precious memories in my heart
Appear in my dream

I'm always dreaming in my dream
I'm talking to myself
"Oh dear, there's nothing to fear"
Still looking for a place where we live
I've got to get back, shiny light
pulls my hand and leads me

Now is the time to say goodbye
I am moving forward
With the momentum of hope
Hold hands with you, I'll be okay
In this journey, we are still bonding
our strength to be strong
Forevermore, forevermore

Petals of wish pour down on us
Come with me, let's go to see the moonlight
Come with me, let's go to see the moonlight
